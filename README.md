## 💻 Usage Examples

### Basic Query Processing
```python
from granite_generation import FinAIAdvisor

# Initialize the advisor
advisor = FinAIAdvisor()

# Ask about UPI safety
response = advisor.query("How can I safely use UPI for payments?")
print(response)

# Budget planning assistance
response = advisor.query("Help me create a monthly budget with ₹50,000 income")
print(response)

# Fraud prevention guidance
response = advisor.query("I received a suspicious call asking for my bank details. What should I do?")
print(response)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple queries
queries = [
    "What are UPI transaction limits?",
    "How to identify fake payment apps?",
    "Best practices for credit card usage",
    "How to start investing with small amounts?"
]

for query in queries:
    response = advisor.query(query)
    print(f"Q: {query}")
    print(f"A: {response}\n")
```
